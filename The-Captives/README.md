This is a simple game with simple rules. Just trap the the grey dot within the matrix of circles. This is one smart dot though...
Just tap on the gray dots and they will turn to blue. The red dot is blocked by these blue dots.

Surround the red dot with the blue dots before it escapes!

But is it even possible?
